#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 
Is a sysytematic and disciplined approach to deeveloping software systems. It involves the application of engineering principles and techniques to the design, development, testing and maintainance of software.

THE IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
QUALITY AND RELIABILITY: Software engineering ensures that software systems are reliable, stable and meet user expectations.
EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY: Software engineering optimizes software development processes, reducing costs and improving time-to-market.
SCALABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY: Enables software systems to scale and adapt to changing business needs.
SECURITY AND SAFETY: Helps identify and mitigate potencial security risks and vulnerabilities.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
MASTERING COMPLEXITY ( 1960s-1980s) -The first milestone focused on managing complexity in software development
-Modular programming: breaking down large progams into smaller, manageable modules.
-STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING:Using control structures, functions, and modules to organize code.
-HIGH-LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: Languages like COBOL, FORTRAN AND C enabled developers to write more abstract, platform-independent code.

MASTERING PROCESS (1980s-2000s)-helped teams deliver software projects more efficiently,with improved quality and reliability.The second milestone emphasized improving software development processes.
-SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES: Approches like waterfall,V-Model and Spiral helped structure the development process.
-PROJECT MANAGEMENT: Techniques like Gantt charts,PERT and CPM enabled better planning and coordination.
-QUALITY ASSURANCE: Practices like testing ,verification and validation ensured software met requirements and standards.

MASTERING MACHINE(2000s- present)
The third milestone focuses on leveraging machine learning ,artificial interlligence, and data-driven approaches to improve software development.This era is characterised by:
-DEVELOPS AND CONTINUOUS INTERGRATION: Automating testing, building and deployment to reduce manua effort and increase efficiency.
-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING: Applying AI and ML to improve software development, testing and maintence.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
PLANNING PHASE-Define project, goals, timelines, budget and resources.Identify potential risks and develop a mitigation plan.
REQUIREMENT GATHERING PHASE-Collect and document functional and non-funtional requirements from stakeholders,users and customers.Create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
DESIGN PHASE-Create a detailed design of the software architecture,components and user interface. Produce a Software Design Document (SDD).
TESTING PHASE-Verify that the software meets the requirements and works as expected. Conduct various types of testing, such as system testing,acceptance and regression testing.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL METHODOLOGY-LINEAR AND SEQUENTIAL:Phases are completed one after the other
-PREDICTIVE:Requirements are gathered upfront and the project plan is created accordingly
-DOCUMENTATION-HEAVY:Detailed documentation is created at each phase
EXAMPLE: A Construction project, building a house or bridge, where the requirements are well-defined and the timeline is fixed.

AGILE METHODOLOGY -ITERATIVE AND INCREMENTAL:Work is divided into small,manageable chunks and phases are repeated in cycles.
ADAPTIVE:Requirements are gathered and refined throughout the project.
CHANGE-FRIENDLY:Changes are welcomed and the project adapts to new requirements.
EXAMPLE: Developing complex software applications with uncertain or changing requirements, such as mobile apps or web applications.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
   
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
  
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.
   
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
INTERGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS (IDEs)
IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY:IDEs provide a comprehensive development environment, streamlining tasks and reducing development time.
ENHANCED CODE QUALITY:Offer code inspection,reducing errors and improving code quality.
SIMPLIFIED DEBUGGING: Provide built-in debugging tools, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
BETTER PROJECT MANAGEMENT:Often include project management such as project navigation, file management  and build automation. 
EXamples-Eclipse
        -Visual Studio
        -NetBeans 
        -PyCharm
VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS (VCS)
-Enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, tracking changes and resolving conflicts.
-Records all changes made to the code,allowing developers to track changes, identify bugs and revert to previous versions
Allows developers to create separate branches for new features or bug fixes, making it easier to manage different versions of codebase.
EXAMPLES- Git
        -Perforce
        -CVS
        Subversion (SVN)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
TECHNICAL DEBT
Legacy code, outdated technologies and quick fixes can lead to techical debt, making maintenance and updates difficult.
STRATEGY:Allocate time for code reviews and pair programming
        :Use design patterns and principles to improve code quality.
        Refactor code regularly
COMMUNITY BREAKDOWNS
Poor communication among team members, stakeholders and customers can lead to misunderstandings, delays and frastration.
STRATEGY:Establish clear communication channels
        :Use collaboration tools such as slack
        :Practice active listening and ask clarifying questions.
BALANCING QUALITYAND SPEED
Software egineers often face pressure to deliver projects fast, but sacrificing quality can lead to technical debt, maintanace issues and customer dissatisfaction
